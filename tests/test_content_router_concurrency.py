"""Regression test for issue #3486: ContentRouter per-request state isolation.

``ContentRouter`` is instantiated once at proxy startup and shared across
all concurrent requests (see ``headroom/proxy/server.py``, which dispatches
``pipeline.apply()`` calls onto a real ``ThreadPoolExecutor``). ``apply()``
stores per-call runtime state -- including the F2.2
``self._runtime_compression_policy`` -- as plain, unsynchronized instance
attributes (``content_router.py`` around line 4837). A second concurrent
``apply()`` call can overwrite that attribute before the first call has
finished reading it, corrupting the first request's view of its own
compression policy with a *different* request's policy.

This test forces that interleaving deterministically: Thread A starts an
``apply()`` call under the Subscription policy (``toin_read_only=True`` --
must NEVER write to the shared TOIN learning pool) and is paused, via a
patched ``_record_to_toin``, right before it reads
``self._runtime_compression_policy``. While paused, Thread B runs a
complete ``apply()`` call under the PAYG policy, which overwrites the
shared attribute. Thread A is then resumed: on the current (unfixed) code
it reads Thread B's PAYG policy instead of its own Subscription policy and
incorrectly writes Subscription-mode content into the shared, cross-user
TOIN learning pool -- a privacy-relevant cross-tenant leak the F2.2 gate
exists specifically to prevent.

See ``tests/test_compression_policy_toin_gate.py`` for the (non-concurrent)
F2.2 gate tests this mirrors, and
``tests/test_code_compressor_thread_safety.py`` for the
Event/ThreadPoolExecutor style this follows.
